This is a little program I wrote for my teaching team this summer and put up on Heroku so we could access it on our phones. An easy way to pick students randomly is a handy tool for leading an equitable classroom. This has my students' names hard-coded, and picks randomly without replacement until all students have been picked. At anytime, the 'Reset' button puts all the students in the bucket and picking without replacement resumes.
